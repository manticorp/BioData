BioData
=======

A universal data format for all Biometric Data in all common formats (JSON, XML, CSV, etc).

At the moment this repository consists of a set of PHP classes for creating BioData objects. Full documentation will be provided at version 0.1.

## Example Usage

    <?php
    include 'BioData\BioData.php';
    
    // BioData\Sleep($measurement = null, $units = null, $start = null, $finish = null);
    // In this case, create a piece of sleep biodata that records the length of sleep.
    // The measurement is null, but could be used to record quality of sleep in %.
    $var = new BioData\Sleep(null, null, new DateTime("Yesterday 8pm"), new DateTime("Today 8am"));
    
    ?>
